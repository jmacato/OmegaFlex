A combined NAND/GPU signal/U10 relocation flexible PCB for Nintendo Wii revision 40/60

This flexible PCB combines the goodness of NAND, Wii's GPU signals and the U10 in one package. It also has breakouts for GameCube controller 1/2 data lines with pull up resistors, MODE pin pullup solder bridge pad and USB/Bluetooth data lines as well.

Its primary goal is to reduce the mess of magnet wires in portables and to make the Wii as something of a removable module that can be reused without resoldering when you want to upgrade your portables in the future.

PCBWay can fabricate this easily as well. Kinda expensive though and the ideal number of flex per batch is 25 pcs. But it's so worth it :)
